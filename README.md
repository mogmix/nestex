# nesTeX

Interactive python script for compiling tex files.

Especially useful for larger documents with nested output directories.
Here, latexmk will usually fail as it will not make all subdirectories.

## Usage

1. Configure the environmental variables and paths at the top of the script to suit your structure.

2. `python build.py`

3. From there, you can navigate through the options.
